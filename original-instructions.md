# Phantom Slayer #

**Phantom Slayer** is a chase game played in a three-dimensional maze. Each maze is inhabited by evil Phantoms which can destroy you with a single touch. **Your mission** - destroy them before they destroy you! The graphics in **Phantom Slayer** are a three-dimensional representation.

You are occasionally given the opportunity to view the maze from above, but usually you must operate from inside it. Look into your monitor as though you were looking down a hallway. To move forward one step, press the up arrow. the right and left arrows turn you to the right and left. The down arrow moves you one step backwards.

Moving and turning produce smoothly moving graphics on the screen, showing you a view of the maze as you move or turn. Your enemies in the maze are the Phantoms. If a Phantom touches you, you are destroyed. They always know where you are and will try to reach you by the most direct path. You destroy Phantoms with your laser pistol.

It may take more than one hit from your pistol to kill a Phantom. When one Phantom is destroyed, another is created to take its place. There are never more than three Phantoms in the maze at once. As the game progresses, the Phantoms become harder to destroy. At the beginning, a Phantom never takes more than three hits, but later they may require more.

Once a Phantom is destroyed, you have a chance to look at the maze from above for a few seconds. Do this by pressing the `d` key just after you have destroyed a Phantom. You also see this view at the beginning of the game. In this map, the Phantoms are denoted by red dots. You are the striped block. The maze is a randomly generated 20 x 20 grid, and you begin the game near its centre.

Your weapons are a laser pistol and a Phantom detector. Your pistol is ‘armed’ by pressing the `space` bar. releasing the `space` bar fires. Arming causes a cross-hair sight to appear, automatically centered on the target. Once your pistol is armed, you cannot move or turn until it is fired.

**Important:** it takes about 2 seconds to recharge your pistol after it has been fired. The Phantom detector is an audio tone triggered by nearby Phantoms. You select the triggering distance by pressing the numeric keys from 1 to 6. It is initially set at 4. The Phantom detector is triggered by Phantoms at the distance you set, regardless of intervening walls.

By changing the triggering distance, you can get an accurate reading of the distance between you and the Phantom. The green square can be a very valuable escape route. It is randomly placed in the maze at the beginning of the game. If you stand on it, you can return to your starting point in the game by pressing the `Enter` key.

Once you have used a particular green square, it disappears and a new one is generated somewhere else in the maze. The green square is not shown in the maze map, except at the end of the game. At the beginning of each game, you may vary the difficulty by changing the maze type and Phantom speed. The mazes can be either type 1, a fairly open maze, or type 2, a dense maze with many twists, turns and dead ends.

It is easier to navigate a type 1 maze, but it is also easier for the Phantoms to reach you. The speed selection (from 1 to 3) determines the speed of movement of the Phantoms. You can always move faster than any Phantom. For either of these questions, hitting enter will default the value to that of the last game played.

**Phantom Slayer** includes a training mode. in this mode, no Phantoms are in the maze and you can get used to the maze graphics. In training mode, you can always view the maze from above by pressing the `d` key. To enter training mode, press `t` when you are asked for speed selection. You then choose a maze type and the training begins. To exit training mode, press `r`.

You score 2 points for each hit and 10 points for each ‘kill’. At the end of each game (i.e. at your death) the map and the score are displayed. If `Enter` is hit at this point a new game begins with the same speed and maze type as the last. Any other key will return you to the speed and maze type questions. A game can be ended at any point by pressing the `r` key.

**Strategy:** since it may take more than 1 hit to kill a Phantom, and your pistol takes time to recharge, you must learn to fire, turn and run from Phantoms. You will find that certain arrangements of hallways and corners are best for this tactic, and that other arrangements are perfect spots for a Phantom ambush on you. Remember the green square as an escape route.
